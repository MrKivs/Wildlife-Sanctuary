        <h2>Jackal</h2>
        <p>
          The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty
          red coat, a black patch on its back, and a black-tipped tail. It
          measures around 95 centimeters (37 inches) from head to tail. As
          opportunistic omnivores, jackals eat what they can. They work in
          family groups to hunt small antelopes, but they'll also feed on
          reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and carcasses left by
          larger predators. There are two distinct populations of black-backed
          jackals in Africa one in in countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, and
          Tanzania, and one in southern Af countries including Namibia, Angola,
          and South Africa. These animals live in a wide variety of habitats,
          from deserts to grasslands to The IUCN lists black-backed jackals as
          least concern, meaning they face few However, they are hunted by
          farmers who kill them to protect their livestock.
