        <h2>Hyena</h2>
        <p>
          There are two species of hyenas in Kenya the striped hyena and the
          spotted hyena. They can be found throughout Africa, in all habitats
          except rainforests. The spotted hyena (also called the laughing hyena)
          is the largest hyena species, with the females being larger than the
          males. Their coats are patterned with dark spots. These animals hunt
          fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and can work in packs to take down
          wildebeests or antelopes. Striped hyenas are lesser known than their
          spotted cousins. They are more scavengers than hunters and typically
          come out at night to feed on carcasses left by other animals. The
          spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN as least concern, and the striped
          hyena is near threatened. Human-wildlife conflict is the main threat
          to their survival.
