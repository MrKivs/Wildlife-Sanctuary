        <h2>Cheetah</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most recognizable animals in Kenya is the cheetah.These
          spotty cats each with their own unique patterns are skilled hunters,
          in part because of their natural speed and agility. In fact, cheetahs
          are the fastest mammals on earth. They can accelerate from zero to 60
          miles per hour in just three seconds. Another interesting cheetah
          fact? Unlike lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards, cheetahs can't roar
          they can only purr.These cats live and hunt in open grasslands across
          Africa. They can be found in countries including Kenya, Algeria, South
          Africa, and Niger. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes cheetahs as vulnerable. This means the species is at high risk of extinction. There are just 6,517 mature cheetahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing. Cheetah are at particular risk from habitat loss because they need such a large range. Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers.
